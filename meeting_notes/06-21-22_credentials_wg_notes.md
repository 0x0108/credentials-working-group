## Demo

Jack Couch at Sophtron: As an aggregator at Sophtron, tbDEX unlocks a lot of what they’re looking to do. Behind the scenes it’s always a connection into the banks to pull data, and it’s usually not via API. Data is pulled multiple times a day for each app. Every person in the US has a third party connecting to banking data on their behalf. And it’s a poor user experience because people don’t like waiting for data to load. There is currently no way to share bank data with a lender - you instead give access to a thirdparty to do this for you. Open Banking is an initiative which encourages open APIs and standards in the banking industry, but it’s adoption has been limited. In the tbDEX model, the user retains their banking data, but it’s issued and signed by the provider. This is exciting for Sophtron and builders of fintech apps - relieving them of the responsibility to connect to and store sensitive data. The model additionally does not have conflicts of interest in the permissionless network model.

Moved to new Voice Channel.

Jack continued with Demo.

Goal: within 12 months, be issuing millions of verifiable credentials for banking information. The VC is an extra wrapper that a verifier can parse as they’ve been doing. Jack feels it’s a smooth migration path from what verifiers are doing now to what they may do in a verifiable credential model.

## Discussion

Megan
KYC is regional. NYC has different requirements from Europe or Asia.
Non-KYC data is another valuable case used by banks and financial institutions. For instance - verifiable accounts are open, have sufficient funds, etc.
Jack
Yes, agree - the KYC angle is region-specific. 
And there are other non-financial providers like utility bills which can be used 
Another type of VC - something issued from a bank saying only that “you are a person, you have a bank account” - could be used to verify personhood vs. automated services.
Angie, reading from questions:
If the VC is stored in DWNs, can it be hacked?
Gabe: 
Gabe and Daniel: as secure as cryptographic keys, multiple layers
Megan:
Jack, can you say more about open banking and if it’s multiregion?
Jack: 
Not aware; Sophtron is mostly focused on North America.
Jack:
All of our Sophtron customers are institutions, mostly large - and they’re behind fintech apps. Jack is optimistic that they’d be receptive to the type of industry change brought about by VCs once the infrastructure is in place.

## Next steps

Meeting Minutes in future sessions to be done in HackMD and shared with folks. Then can be committed.
